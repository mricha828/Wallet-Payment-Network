Wallet payment Network Database Management
WALLET is a payment network, similar to Venmo and Zelle, that enables individuals to
electronically transfer money to others.
Users can sign up with WALLET (that is, create an account with WALLET) by providing
their name, SSN, an email address, and a phone number. Only one phone can be
recorded for each WALLET account, but a WALLET account can be associated with
multiple email addresses. Email addresses and phone numbers can be recorded in the
database but they should be verified before they can be used – i.e., a user should
prove that she owns an email address or a phone number by entering correctly the
code that is sent via email or SMS respectively. A user’s identity is confirmed if her
email addresses and phone number are verified. The system should be able to record
both verified and non-verified email addresses and phone numbers.
